# Telephone-Call-Bills
Prints the bills amount based on the telephone calls made.
The telephone call bills are charged in this way:

First 150 calls are free
Next 250 calls (151-400 minute) are charged at the rate of 1/minute
And all calls after 400 minutes, are charged at the rate of 2/minute
For example, if customer made a total call of 620 minutes. Then calculation of phone call bills charge goes like:

620 calls = 150 (Free) + 250 (at 1/minute) + 220 (at 2/minute)
          = 0 + (250*1) + (220*2)
          = 250 + 440
          = 690
Therefore, 690 is the phone call bills that will get charge after attending 620 calls or 620 minutes of calls.
